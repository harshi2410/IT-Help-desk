🛠️ Salesforce Help Desk – Admin Project
A simple IT Help Desk system built entirely using Salesforce Admin tools (no code).

What I Built
Custom Object: Ticket__c
Fields: Subject, Description, Priority (High / Medium / Low), Status (New / In Progress / Resolved / Closed), Assigned To (lookup to User)
Page Layouts: Clean layout for creating and viewing tickets
Validation Rule: Prevents closing a ticket without filling in the resolution notes
Record Types (optional): e.g., "Hardware", "Software", "Access Request"
List Views: “My Open Tickets”, “High Priority Tickets”
Reports & Dashboard:
Report: Open tickets by priority
Dashboard: Shows total open tickets and status breakdown
Permission Set: Help_Desk_Agent – gives agents access to manage tickets
All configuration done declaratively in Setup using standard Salesforce Admin features, can be expanded anytime as practiced many other small projects as well.
